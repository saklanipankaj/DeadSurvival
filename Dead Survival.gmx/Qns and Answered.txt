1. Why do we need a global state for high score if we have a different room for it.
Cause You are going to use the Control object to access data for the highscore and stuff.
The Control object will be in all room, cause its persistent. And u use it to
show all the stats and stuff
2. Room_goto does not remove the button sprites
cause state never change u need do that forget sorry
